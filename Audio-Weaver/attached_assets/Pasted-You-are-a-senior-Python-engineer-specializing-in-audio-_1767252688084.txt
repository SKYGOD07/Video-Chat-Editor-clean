You are a senior Python engineer specializing in audio-video processing tools.

Objective:
Build a TERMINAL-BASED (CLI) podcast-style video editor in Python.

The program must run using:
python main.py

No web server.
No frontend.
No GUI.
Only terminal input/output.

Core Workflow (MANDATORY):
1. Program starts in terminal
2. Ask user to provide:
   - Path to main video file
   - Path to audio file 1 (speaker A)
   - Path to audio file 2 (speaker B)
3. Validate files
4. Analyze audio tracks
5. Then interactively ask editing instructions

Terminal Interaction Flow:
- Ask:
  "How many timeline segments do you want to create?"
- For each segment:
  - Ask start time (HH:MM:SS)
  - Ask end time (HH:MM:SS)
  - Ask which audio source to prioritize (audio1 / audio2 / mix)
- Ask if silence removal is needed
- Ask if segments should be merged or exported separately

Podcast Logic (IMPORTANT):
- Use audio energy / timestamps to decide which speaker is dominant
- Arrange video cuts based on active speaker audio
- Sync cuts accurately
- Final output should feel like a podcast editor

Tech Stack (STRICT):
- Python 3.10+
- FFmpeg (CLI)
- ffmpeg-python OR subprocess
- Silero-VAD (for speech detection)
- pydub (audio slicing)
- numpy
- torch (CPU only)

Required Features:
- Multiple timeline cuts
- Silence removal
- Audio-based segment prioritization
- Merge final video
- Save output to /output folder

Project Structure (MANDATORY):

podcast_video_editor/
├── main.py
├── core/
│   ├── input_handler.py
│   ├── timeline_manager.py
│   ├── audio_analyzer.py
│   ├── silence_remover.py
│   ├── ffmpeg_engine.py
│   └── merger.py
├── utils/
│   └── time_parser.py
├── output/
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md

Rules:
- FULL runnable code only
- Clear terminal prompts
- Handle invalid input gracefully
- Assume FFmpeg is installed
- No placeholder functions
- No pseudocode

Output Instructions:
1. Generate folder structure
2. Generate all Python files
3. Generate requirements.txt
4. Generate README with terminal usage
5. Stop after complete CLI tool is built

This is a functional podcast-style editor, not a demo.
